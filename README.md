Hi everyone.
I am keunha lee from South of korea.
The product attathed is the sports shopping mall.
This is the project made with angular 9 and typescript along with bootstrap 4 library. I designed this sight by referencing the world famous sports shopping mall which is Nike.
It is not finished yet and still in progress. Therefore I will update the project whenever I add new features.

If you have any question or advice, please contact to leetoya2@naver.com
Thanks





*** Guide to start the project ***

To implement the project, it requires two command prompts.

First one is for RESTful web service. To start the RESTful web service, open a command prompt and run the following command in the installed folder: "npm run json" 
Then, open a second command prompt and run the following command in the folder to start the development tools and HTTP server: "ng serve --open"
